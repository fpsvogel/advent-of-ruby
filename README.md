# Advent of Code â€“ Ruby

These are my Advent of Code solutions in Ruby.

The included CLI utility is [AoC-rb](https://github.com/Keirua/aoc-cli) with a few tweaks, as well as some added commands:


- `aoc submit YEAR DAY PART`: submits the answer of a puzzle, for part `1` or `2`.
- `aoc instructions YEAR DAY`: downloads the instructions for a puzzle and shows it in your editor (specified by `editor_command` in config.yml).
