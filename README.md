# Advent of Code â€“ Ruby

These are my Advent of Code solutions in Ruby.

The included CLI utility is based on [AoC-rb](https://github.com/Keirua/aoc-cli), with some additions. These are the commands:

- `aoc bootstrap YEAR DAY`: downloads the input and instructions files, and creates a source file and a spec file for the given day.
- `aoc run YEAR DAY [PART]`: runs part `1` or `2` of the given day.
- `aoc submit YEAR DAY PART`: runs part `1` or `2` of the given day and submits the resulting answer.
- `aoc others YEAR DAY PART`: downloads and shows other people's solutions, from these repos:
