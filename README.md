# Advent of Code â€“ Ruby

These are my Advent of Code solutions in Ruby.

The included CLI utility is [AoC-rb](https://github.com/Keirua/aoc-cli) with a few tweaks, as well as some added commands:


- `aoc submit YEAR DAY PART`: submits the answer of a puzzle, for part `1` or `2`.
- `aoc instructions YEAR DAY`: outputs the instructions for a puzzle.
  - Or you can open the file `instructions/ddyy.md` where `dd` is the day and `yy` is the year (last two digits).
