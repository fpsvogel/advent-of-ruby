# Advent of Code â€“ Ruby

These are my Advent of Code solutions in Ruby.

The included CLI utility is [AoC-rb](https://github.com/Keirua/aoc-cli) with a few tweaks, as well as some added commands:

- `aoc submit YEAR DAY PART`: submits the answer of a puzzle, for part `1` or `2`.
- `aoc instructions YEAR DAY`: downloads the instructions for a puzzle and shows it in your editor (specified by `editor_command` in config.yml).

[aoc-cli](https://github.com/apexatoll/aoc-cli) is another CLI tool that has these features built in. I chose AoC-rb only because it's simpler (having fewer features) and therefore easier to customize.
